# Olympics-Data-Analytics

## Project Title

This project demonstrates building a data engineering pipeline for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics dataset, which includes details of over 11,000 athletes, 47 disciplines, and 743 teams. The pipeline is implemented using Azure Data Factory for orchestration and Databricks for data transformation. The data is ingested from Azure Data Lake Storage and processed to generate insights into athlete participation by country, gender, and discipline. Spark and SQL queries are used for aggregating and analyzing data. The project showcases Azure based tools for handling large datasets and automating ETL processes.
